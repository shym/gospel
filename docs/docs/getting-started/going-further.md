# Going further

This tutorial only covered very few features of Gospel. Please feel free to
visit our other resources before getting started:

- If you like to learn by example, the [walk-through](../walkthroughs/introduction.md) section
  contains a gallery of more advanced use-cases extracted from real-world
  interfaces. Those should help you familiarize yourself with the process of
  formal specification.

- If you prefer to read the manual for more in-depth information on specific
  features of the language, you may also visit the [language
  reference](../language/syntax) section.

Finally, we are always thrilled to hear your thoughts or questions regarding
Gospel and this tutorial. Please feel free to [open a
discussion](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/discussions/new) and share
your issues and ideas!
