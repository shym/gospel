# Welcome!

Welcome to the Gospel documentation. We provide several resources
to get you started with formal specifications for your OCaml programs.

- If you are entirely new to Gospel, please head out to the [Getting
  Started](getting-started/installation) section. You'll learn how to install
  Gospel and then use it to write your first specification.
- The [Walk-through](walkthroughs/introduction) section showcases real-world OCaml
  interfaces, including a comprehensive explanation of the specification process and
  language features.
- More detailed explanations of the language features are available in the
  [Language Reference](language/syntax) section.
- Short questions sometimes deserve short answers. You can also check out the
  [FAQ](faq) section for common questions about Gospel's design,
  semantics, and features.

We are dedicated to making Gospel an easy-to-use specification language for
OCaml developers. Any comment or suggestion on the language or its documentation
is welcome. Please feel free to [open a
discussion](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/discussions/new) on Github to
share your ideas or ask questions.
